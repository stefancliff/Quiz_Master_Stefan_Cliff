# Quiz Master - Stefan Cliff

 This is a UI orientated game where I have learned to use/create UI elements as well as lists/array manipulation and data saving.
 
 The Theme for the Quiz was D&D 5e.
 
 So far, I've learned a bit more when it comes to timer manipulation as well as setting up Scriptable Objects, loading them into an array and then loading
 their values onto UI elements. 

 Creating a score system as well as a progress bar that updates based on how many questions are left, a random selector for the order of the questions as well as a final screen
 where the players score is shown in a % value have all been pretty transferable knowledge.

 With the creation of a Game Manager, the player will be able to restart the game whenever they wish which is a handy bit of know-how to have. Especially in shorter games with a repeatable gameplay loop.
